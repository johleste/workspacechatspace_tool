# workspacechatspace_tool

This is intended to use methods from Google Developer Preview Program, so this will be required in order to use the functionality of this.

It is intended to take a list of spaces and make unilateral changes to all of them. You can edit the CSV in order to make changes to a select number of them.


Google's Chat API uses the space resource to manage the space on the back end: https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#accessstate
By using the spaces.patch method, you can change the accessState or the target audience for the space.
